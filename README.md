graphMT
=======

Package for graph-based machine translation. 

If building for the first time, just run the 'autogen' script, with
the location to your eigen directory as the argument. 

If you're just recompiling after configuring, you can just write 'make'

If you want to clean up (say before checking in files to github), just
run the 'antigen' script.
